- add compat for all types of leader traits
- swap academy trait upgrade to select which from list
- create total creation AP for total control of worlds and perks
- create ability for psi sensors to see through nebulae, and stations with listening posts
- add event to add all ship types at start of game, because I strongly believe that would be an interesting experiment
- expand orbital ring levels to be chonkier, and take more modules / buildings because NSC2 would do that
- fix certain shipsets showing weapons and sections
- stop machines from getting psi weapon techs and Psi techs in general


completed
- create merger of shipsets, fix Mass Effect Shipsets to be not trash
- compat patch habitat hq buildings cause they need it THIS WAS UNECESSARY
